# Voodoo MultiCoinLib

### This project is under development and shouldn't be used in production

MultiCoinLib is an implementation of various crypto coin clients in C#, based on the work by Nicolas Dorier in [NBitcoin](https://github.com/NicolasDorier/NBitcoin) and his series of related articles on [CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/768412/NBitcoin-The-most-complete-Bitcoin-port-Part-Crypt).

The library is designed to be easily extendable with new coins, and not depend on the original client running to be able to function and communicate with the network.

Currently implemented coins ...

* Bitcoin
* Litecoin
* Dogecoin
